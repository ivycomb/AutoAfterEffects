# AutoAfterEffects
AutoAfterEffects (or AutoAE for short) is a collection of autohotkey scripts specifically designed to increase workflow speed when animating. These scripts are designed around my workflow but can be adapted and changed.

If you have many tasks in After Effects that are very repetitive, nuanced, or slow, but are always done in the same format, then these should probably be automated. I'm used to looping out keyframes on dozens of layers during several projects in a single day, and removing the human element from these this can save several minutes of time and overall increase working pace.

## Prerequesite Knowledge
In order to use these scripts, you will need at least a [beginner understanding of AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm), and an intuitive understanding of problem solving. 

You will also of course need AutoHotKey installed. You can download AHK for free [HERE](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
